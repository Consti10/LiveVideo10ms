         * A thread priority should be chosen inverse-proportionally to
         * the amount of work the thread is expected to do. The more work
         * a thread will do, the less favorable priority it should get so that
         * it doesn't starve the system. Threads not behaving properly might
         * be "punished" by the kernel.
         * Use the levels below when appropriate. Intermediate values are
         * acceptable, preferably use the {MORE|LESS}_FAVORABLE constants below.
